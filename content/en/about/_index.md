## About Us  
We are a highly motivated team of students from different grade levels at BG/BRG Keimgasse Mödling.  
What unites us is our passion for research and technology, with a focus on robotics.  
We spend our Saturdays working together on the international competition “FIRST Lego League.”  

## What We Do  

### Robot Game  
We build and program a Lego robot that completes as many tasks as possible on a predefined playing field within 2:30 minutes.  

### Research  
We prepare a research presentation, which we present in a 5-minute time frame.  

### Core Values  
In this category, our teamwork, interactions, and collaborative problem-solving are evaluated.  

### Robot Design  
We present the design of our robot, our programs, and our solution strategies.
