In recent years, our Lego competition team has been very successful,
participating in the D-A-CH finals three times in a row.
Last season, we even made it to the World Finals in Norway. After
taking 1st place in the regional competition, we qualified again this year for the D-A-CH final. Our goal is to reach the World Finals once more this year.
However, we regularly need materials for building the Lego robots, carrying out the research project, and presenting ourselves as a team (T-shirts, banners). We urgently need your support to cover material and travel costs.
In return, we will give you media exposure on the school website as well as at the competitions.

You too can contribute to our success. For this, we have set up a [GoFundMe campaign](https://gofund.me/36289d14).
